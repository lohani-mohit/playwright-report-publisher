| `report-url`  | URL to the published Playwright report |
| `test-status` | Status of the tests (passed or failed) |

## How It Works

1. **Test Execution**: The action runs Playwright tests with the specified tag
2. **Report Generation**: A test report is generated in HTML and JSON formats
3. **GCS Upload**: The report is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage with a timestamp
4. **Result Posting**: Results are posted to Slack and/or GitHub PR comments

## Requirements

For this action to work correctly, you need:

1. **Playwright Tests**: Your repository should have Playwright tests set up
2. **GCP Service Account**: A Google Cloud service account with permissions to upload to a GCS bucket
3. **Slack Webhook** (optional): A Slack webhook URL if you want to post results to Slack

## Setting Up the Required Secrets

### GCP Service Account

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Platform
2. Grant it the `Storage Object Creator` role
3. Create a key for the service account in JSON format
4. Add the JSON content to your GitHub repository secrets as `GCP_SA_KEY`

### Slack Webhook URL

1. Create a Slack app in your workspace
2. Enable Incoming Webhooks
3. Create a webhook for the channel where you want to post test results
4. Add the webhook URL to your GitHub repository secrets as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Customizing the Report URL Format

The default format for the report URL is:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{tag}-{env}/{timestamp}/index.html
```

You can customize this by forking the action and modifying the `generate-paths` step in the action.yml file.

## Examples

### Running Visual Comparison Tests

```yaml
- name: Run Visual Comparison Tests
  uses: speechify/playwright-report-publisher@v1
  with:
    test-tag: "@visualcomparison"
    environment: "prod"
    gcp-sa-key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
```

### Daily Sanity Tests with Slack Notifications Only

```yaml
name: Daily Sanity Tests

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *" # Run daily at 2 AM UTC

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Sanity Tests
        uses: speechify/playwright-report-publisher@v1
        with:
          test-tag: "@sanity"
          environment: "prod"
          post-to: "slack"
          gcp-sa-key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
